I used %define parse.error verbose to get the read of the errors being made to 
the parser.  I then went into the lpp file for the cerr output to have line 
number and column number print out with the error message.  I also did error
checking in the bison file in the classDeclaration and classBody nodes.
If they find an error it will print out line number column number and tell you
there is an error in the classDeclaration or classBody area.
